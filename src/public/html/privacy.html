    <li>
        if using a <strong>third-party</strong> instance, there may be some form of server-side
        logging (which is usually harmless); in this case, to get information, you must contact the
        instance administrator
    </li>
    <li>
        if <strong>self-hosting</strong>, your <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address is
        shared with Firebaseio, Hnpwa, Hckrnews and Algolia in order to provide threads and searches
